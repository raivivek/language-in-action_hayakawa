1.

The discourse between Carol and Patricia is a strong indication of how deeply
language is embedded in our everyday life. We are constantly, often
unconsciously, making connections between the words we use and hear and our
assumptions about the language.

For instance, in this example, Carol asserts her (implicit) assumption about
naming practices. That is, there must be an obvious relation between the name of
a person and their prominent characteristic. *Patricia* does not need to look
like a patricia to be called Patricia.

2.

Why do straight lines or angles need to represent energy and organization? It
might as well have been a parabolic curve or a circle, or that straight lines
could have indicated monotonicity and lack of energy.

Quite similar to the *dog-eat-dog* philosophy discussed by author at the start
of the chapter. These assumptions are simply based on some arbitrarily developed
idea that happened to influence a lot of people, which in turn reinforced this
notion further (think of a positive feedback loop).

Characterizing things by their names is a common practice that stems from our
strong linguistic ability to establish arbitrary symbolic identity. For example,
if a word is the name for a flower, the word implicitly becomes a representative
of the characteristics of the flower itself. Often, this process is unconscious
and significant part of our daily niagra of words constitutes of similar
associations. Further, what makes this process even complicated is that these
associations and non-singular and dynamic.

Naturally, such an interplay of language has been a major literary interest by
writers. For example, using names like Blunt, Hostpur etc., triggers the
meanings we associate with these words and hence make inferences about how do we
the expect the character in the story to be. In fact, by just using a suitable
name, an excelled writer can avoid having to provide a good deal of description
to make justifications.

In other words, make use of others understanding of words without having to
justify yours.

5.

The paragraph is a good demonstration of how different linguistic habits across
different cultures can visibly shape the thought and behavior people. It can
also give rise to several connotations about the way anything is done in
a particular culture compared to other.

In the example paragraph, the French women reacts to her own connotations of
French language that she might herself be unaware of. That is, different types
of tones, intensity of voice and facial expressions that accompany a word
and associate to a certain type of behavior *need not* correspond to same behavior
for a person from different language or culture. So in this case, probably
a slight higher voice intensity and cold pronunciation comes off as a hostile
gesture to a French while it is quite innocent for a Russian.
